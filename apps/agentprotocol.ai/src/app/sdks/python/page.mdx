# Python Agent Protocol SDKs

This is our recommended way to implement agent protocol for your agent.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/packages/sdk/python).

## Installation

```bash
pip install agent-protocol
```

## Architecture

The SDK is fairly simple. In the center of SDK is a `Agent` class. It has a `setup_agent` method that you can have to use to setup your agent. The method takes two arguments: `task_handler` and `step_handler`.

- `task_handler` is a function that will be called when a new task is created.
- `step_handler` is a function that will be called when a next step is triggered

### Task handler

The `task_handler` function should create initial step(s) for the task based on the task input. You can use `Agent.db.create_step` to create a new step.

### Step handler

The `step_handler` function should handle the next step. You can create / remove / reorder the next steps. By default, the SDK will take the first step with status `created`. If you need to change this behavior, you can override the `router` for **[POST]** `/agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` endpoint.

Next important of the `Agent` is `db` attribute. It is an instance of class that serves for storing and retrieving data. The default implementation stores data in the memory. You can replace it with your own implementation.

In the package you can also find `router` object. It is an instance of [`APIRouter`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/?h=router#apirouter) from [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that you can extend or override some of the endpoints.

## Usage

The typical agent workflow is consisting of an iteration over some predefined steps or looping over them.

The good practice is to let user know all the known steps that will be executed and let them decide if they want to continue or not. This can be done by creating all the so far known steps.

Let's illustrate this on the example of an agent that will in the first step `plan` all his steps and then execute them.

```python
from agent_protocol import Agent, Step, Task


async def plan(step: Step) -> Step:
    task = await Agent.db.get_task(step.task_id)
    steps = generete_steps(task.input)

    last_step = steps[-1]
    for step in steps[:-1]:
       await Agent.db.create_step(task_id=task.task_id, name=step, ...)

    await Agent.db.create_step(task_id=task.task_id, name=last_step, is_last=True)
    step.output = steps
    return step


async def execute(step: Step) -> Step:
    # Use tools, websearch, etc.
    ...

async def task_handler(task: Task) -> None:
    await Agent.db.create_step(task_id=task.task_id, name="plan", ...)


async def step_handler(step: Step) -> Step:
    if step.name == "plan":
        await plan(step)
    else:
        await execute(step)

   return step


Agent.setup_agent(task_handler, step_handler).start()
```
