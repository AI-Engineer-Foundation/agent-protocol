# Own Implementation

Maybe there isn't an SDK for your programming language, maybe you need something extra, or maybe you just want to do it yourself. In that case, you can implement the Agent Protocol yourself.

## Generating models

To reduce the amount of writing boilerplate, you can generate the models from the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/blob/main/schemas/openapi.yml) using some of the tools available [here](https://openapi.tools/).

## Test your implementation

To test your implementation, you can use the [Agent Protocol Compliance Test](/compliance).

## Contribute

If you have implemented the Agent Protocol in your programming language, please consider contributing it to the community. You can do so by creating a pull request to the [Agent Protocol repository](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/).
