# Test your agent

To check if your agent is compliant with the Agent Protocol, you can use the [Agent Protocol Testing Suite](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/testing_suite). The testing suite uses `npm` and `newman` to run a Postman routine against the agent. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can test your agent's compliance by running the following command:

```shell
URL=http://localhost:8000 bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://agentprotocol.ai/test.sh)"
```

The command will run a series of tests against your agent endpoints and check if the responses are compliant with the Agent Protocol.

## CI Pipeline

We advise you to add the validator as a part of your CI pipeline. It’s very
minimal and the setup is simple.

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    name: Validate agent protocol compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install agent requirements
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run agent and validate compliance
        run: |
          <command to run your agent> & # Make sure to use the ampersand to detach your agent
          URL=<your-agent-url> bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://agentprotocol.ai/test.sh)"
```

You can then add a badge to your agent to show it is agent protocol compliant.
