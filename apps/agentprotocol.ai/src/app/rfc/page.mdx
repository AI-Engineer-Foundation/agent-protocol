# Feature requests

Agent Protocol should be a product of a community of agent builders. We want to work with the community to define the protocol in a way that is easy to understand and implement.
RFC (Request for comments) is a way how we want to discuss and propose new ideas for the project.

## RFC Process

1. Create a new branch from `main` with the name `rfc/your-rfc-name`
2. Create a new file in `rfcs` folder with the name `your-rfc-name.md`
3. Write your RFC
4. Create a PR to `main` branch
5. Discuss and iterate on your RFC
6. By default, RFCs are accepted after week of discussion
7. After RFC is accepted, the PR is merged
8. New version of the protocol is released and RFC marked as completed

## RFC Template

You can find a template for RFC in [`rfcs/template.md`](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/blob/main/rfcs/template.md).
