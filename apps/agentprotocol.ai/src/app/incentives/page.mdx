# Why to adopt the protocol?

Using the protocol should have many benefits for you as a developer. Here are some of the most important ones:

## Ease with which you can use the benchmarks.

The protocol is adopted in [benchmarks](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Benchmarks), a benchmarking tool for [Agent Evals](https://github.com/agbenchmark/agent-evals/tree/main). If your agent uses _Agent Protocol_, you can use very simply test your agent and benchmark it against other agents. This will allow you to see how your agent performs compared to others and how you can improve it.

## Other people can more easily use and integrate your agent

By having the standard protocol, other people can just use their current setup to try your agent. There'll be ready to use SDKs, clients, UIs. Also, this means that you can more easily collaborate with other people, because of the expected structure.

## Enable building general devtools (for development, deployment and monitoring) that can be built on top of this protocol

Similarly, this enables to create tools to develop, deploy and monitor agents without extra configuration or boilerplate.

## You donâ€™t need to write boilerplate API and you can focus on developing your agent

Building agents should be about the agent itself, not thinking about how to integrate it with other agents., how to deploy it or how to monitor it. This protocol should help you with that.
