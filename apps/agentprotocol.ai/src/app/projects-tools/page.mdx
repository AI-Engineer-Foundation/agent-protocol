# Project and tools

This is an overview of projects and tools using Agent Protocol.

## Agents

- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) - An experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous
- [Smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer) - Your own junior developer
- [waggledance.ai](https://github.com/agi-merge/waggle-dance) - An open-source multi-agent execution environment that implements the Agent Protocol OpenAPI spec

## Clients

- [AutoGPT UI](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/frontend) - Flutter app designed to facilitate users in discussing various tasks with a single agent.

## Tools

- [Benchmarking](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/benchmark) - An agent protocol client built for the purpose of benchmarking the performance of agents far and wide, regardless of how they are set up and how they work.
- [SDK](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/packages/sdk/python) - A SDK for Agent Protocol written in Python and JS/TS. You can also find more in [SDK](/sdks/)
- [Client](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/packages/client/python) - A client for Agent Protocol written in Python. You can also find more in [Clients](/clients/)
- [AutoGPT Forge](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpts/forge) - The building blocks for an AutoGPT-style agent using the Agent Protocol.
