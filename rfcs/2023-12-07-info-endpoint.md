## Summary

Current methods of information gathering for agents is insufficient, this RFC proposes an info endpoint that would enforce that certain qualities of an agent are readily available. The enclosing proposed fields introduced should enable adequate knowledge-gathering capabilities to consumers of the agent, whether they are a tool, user, or another agent that utilizes the agent protocol.

This RFC assumes that its introduction would fall along a v2 release of the Agent Protocol, and as such any references to the Agent Protocol version reflects that assumption. The proposed new endpoint would exist at `/ap/v2/agent/info` and would be accessed with a `GET` request.

## Motivation

- Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

- Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?

This is a valuable problem to solve if we want orchestrator style systems to be possible and have agents that can have backends updated independently of their frontends. Additionally, this is required moving forward as we make changes to the rpotocol so that consumers of an agent can identify the correct protocol version to support.

Consumers of the agent protocol APIs are currently required to have significant context about the behavior of the agent including the additional inputs as well as any configuration that can be done inside them.
The protocol currently does very little to give context on the specific actions and behaviors that an agent is capable of or where to get more information if needed. This is supported by discussions on [Issue #39](https://github.com/AI-Engineer-Foundation/agent-protocol/issues/39) of the Agent Protocol Spec repo discussing this problem.

## Agent Builders Benefit

- How will the builders benefit? What would be the title in the changelog?

The benefit to agent developers is multi-faceted, the info endpoint allows an agent developer to clarify to external and un-opinionated tools the methods by which the agent functions, e.g. by links to their documentation, instructions on usage, and other materials that may benefit a tool, user, or other agent that has no knowledge of the agent to properly use the agent.

## Design Proposal

\*This section of the paper contains most of your proposal's explanation. If you have several options, make sure to break up the concept into smaller portions and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

This design seeks to add only the bare amount of information required to use the agent. The initial implementation seeks to add only non private information that can be useful for browsing through the agent and getting more information about it.

This RFC proposes to add a `/ap/v2/agent/info` endpoint that returns the following fields:

| Field | Description | Optionality | Type |
| :---- | :---------- | :---------- | :--- |
| `name` | The name of the agent. | **Required** | String |
| `protocol` | The Agent Protocol version that the agent uses to communicate. | **Required** | Integer |
| `version` | The internal version of the agent. | **Required** | String |
| `url` | URL of the agent. | Optional | String |
| `description` | A description of the agent. | Optional | String |
| `git` | Git repository of the agent. | Optional | String |
| `docs` | Link to the documentation of the agent. | Optional | String |
| `issues` | Link to the issues of the agent. | Optional | String

A JSON representation of this table is below:

```json
{
  "name": "My Agent",
  "protocol": 2,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "url": "https://myagent.com",
  "description": "General purpose agent.",
  "git": "https://myselfhostedgit.com/myagent/myagent",
  "docs": "https://myagent.com/docs",
  "issues": "https://github.com/myagent/myagent/issues"
}
```

With this example JSON object in mind, the OpenAPI schema for the relevant fields would be the following:

```yml
AgentInfo:
    description: 
    type: object
    properties:
        name:
            description: The name of the agent.
            type: string
            example: My Agent
        protocol:
            description: The Agent Protocol version that the agent uses to communicate.
            type: integer
            example: 2
        version:
            description: Version of the agent.
            type: string
            example: 1.0.0
        url:
            description: URL of the agent.
            type: string
            example: 'https://my-agent.com'
        description:
            description: Description of the agent.
            type: string
            example: General purpose agent.
        github:
            description: Git repository of the agent.
            type: string
            example: 'https://myselfhostedgit.com/myagent/myagent'
        docs:
            description: Link to the documentation of the agent.
            type: string
            example: 'https://my-agent.com/docs'
        issues:
            description: Link to the issues of the agent.
            type: string
            example: 'https://github.com/myagent/myagent/issues'
        required:
            - name
            - protocol
            - version
```

### Alternatives Considered

- Not having the endpoint:
- Requiring more details on the endpoint:
- Using an external Agentfile approach that would provide metadata for the agent, but would require access to the host filesystem of the agent.

### Compatibility

- Is the design backwards compatible?

  > This design is not backwards compatible but is non breaking. It adds an addtional endpoint that must be implemented but is not a significant burden on developers.

- How can this feature be rolled out?

  > This feature will be rolled out as part of the v2 update that is in progress.

- Will this affect other parts (SDK, Client SDK)?

  > All related libraries will need to be updated to support this endpoint.

## Detailed Design (Optional)

If theyâ€™re important details to understand the design but are too technical for the proposal section above, please provide more information.
