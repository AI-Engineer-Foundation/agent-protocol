## Summary

We just want to be able to list tasks, artifacts and steps in a paginated way.

## Motivation

Every app needs this. It's not really farfetched

## Agent Builders Benefit

- They can paginate their tasks, steps and artifacts.

## Design Proposal

Query parameters for now.

### Alternatives Considered
- query parameter is the simplest, leanest design. We can add more later (body, headers, etc) => let's start lean.
- for now, we won't add the pages in the response of the requests, this is another RFC.

### Compatibility

- This is backwards compatible. We're just adding things.
