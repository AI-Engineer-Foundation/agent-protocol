## Summary

Add agent_created to the artifact response body.

## Motivation

If we don't know whether an artifact is generated by the agent or not, it's hard to know what the agent did or did not do.

## Agent Builders Benefit

- They can tell their users what their agent did.

## Design Proposal

agent_created field in the response body

### Alternatives Considered

### Compatibility

- This is backwards compatible. We're just adding something.
