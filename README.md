# Agent Protocol

This protocol defines an interface for interacting with your agent (and more in the future). 

**The Agent Protocol is tech stack agnostic**. An agent can adopt this protocol no matter what framework they're using (or not using).

Because this protocol is open-source, any platform can adopt it and your agent then becomes automatically compatible with it.
