# Agent Protocol

The reason for creating the Agent Protocol was to provide a standardized way how interact with the agents. This is useful for automation, agent to agent communication, general UIs or dev tools. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Description

The Agent Protocol is a [OpenAPI specification v3](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) based protocol. The protocol is meant to be simple and general, so it can be adopted by any agent.

[//]: # ' TODO: Add link to the open api spec (preferably render it'

The base objects of the protocol are `Task`s, `Step`s and `Artifact`s

### Task

A `Task` denotes one specific goal for the agent, it can be specific like:

```txt
Create a file named `hello.txt` and write `World` to it.
```

or very broad as:

```text
Book a flight from Berlin to New York next week, optimize for price and duration.
```

The `Task` object has the following properties:

| Property           | Type              | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task_id`          | `string`          | The ID of the task.                             |
| `input`            | `string`          | Input prompt for the task.                      |
| `additional_input` | `object`          | Additional input for the task.                  |
| `steps`            | `array[Step]`     | The steps of the task.                          |
| `artifacts`        | `array[Artifact]` | A list of artifacts that the task has produced. |

### Step

A `Step` is a single action that the agent should perform. Each step is triggered by calling the `step` endpoint of the agent. The `Step` object has the following properties:

| Property            | Type              | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_id`           | `string`          | The ID of the task.                                                    |
| `step_id`           | `string`          | The ID of the step.                                                    |
| `input`             | `string`          | Input prompt for the step.                                             |
| `additional_input`  | `object`          | Additional input for the step.                                         |
| `name`              | `string`          | The name of the step.                                                  |
| `status`            | `enum`            | The status of the step. Possible values are `created` and `completed`. |
| `output`            | `string`          | Output of the step.                                                    |
| `additional_output` | `object`          | Additional output of the step.                                         |
| `artifacts`         | `array[Artifact]` | A list of artifacts that the step has produced.                        |
| `is_last`           | `boolean`         | Whether this is the last step in the task.                             |

### Artifact

An `Artifact` is a file that the agent has worked with. The `Artifact` object has the following properties:

| Property        | Type     | Description                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `artifact_id`   | `string` | The ID of the artifact.                                 |
| `file_name`     | `string` | Filename of the artifact.                               |
| `relative_path` | `string` | Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace. |

### Endpoints

The Agent Protocol has two main endpoints:

- `/ap/v1/agent/tasks` **[POST]** - This endpoint is used to create a new task for the agent.
- `/ap/v1/agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` **[POST]** - This endpoint is used to trigger next step of the task.

To see all endpoints and their descriptions, please refer to the [Endpoints](/endpoints).
