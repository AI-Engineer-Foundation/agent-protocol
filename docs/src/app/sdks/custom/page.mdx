# Own Implementation

Maybe there isn't a SDK for your programming language, maybe you need something extra, or maybe you just want to do it yourself. In that case, you can implement the Agent Protocol yourself.

## Generating models

To reduce the amount of writing boilerplate, you can generate the models from the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/blob/main/openapi.yml) using some of the tools available [here](https://openapi.tools/).

## Test your implementation

To test your implementation, you can use the [Agent Protocol Compliance Test](/compliance).

## Contribute

If you have implemented the Agent Protocol in your programming language, please consider contributing it to the community. You can do so by creating a pull request to the [Agent Protocol repository](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/).
