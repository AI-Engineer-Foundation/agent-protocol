# Test compliance

To check if your agent is compliant with the Agent Protocol, you can use the [Agent Protocol SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/sdk/python). The SDK is written in `python`. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can install by running the following command:

```shell
pip install agent-protocol
```

after that you can simply run the following command to test your agent:

```shell
agent-protocol test --url <your-agent-url>
```

The command will run a series of tests against your agent endpoints and check if the responses are compliant with the Agent Protocol.

## CI Pipeline

We advise you to add the validator as a part of your CI pipeline. It’s very
minimal and the setup is simple.

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    name: Validate agent protocol compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install agent protocol
        run: pip install agent-protocol

      - name: Run agent
        run: <command to run your agent>

      - name: Validate agent protocol compliance
        run: agent-protocol test --url <your-agent-url>
```

You can then add a badge to your agent to show it is agent protocol compliant.
